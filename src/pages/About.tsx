              <p>
                Torch Bearer was born from a simple yet powerful idea: that technology and education 
                should work hand in hand to create meaningful change. Founded with the belief that 
                innovation without practical application is just an idea, and education without 
                real-world relevance is just theory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our journey began with a vision to create solutions that don't just exist in isolation 
                but connect, empower, and transform. From developing cutting-edge technical solutions 
                to creating educational content that reaches thousands of learners, every step of our 
                journey has been guided by our core mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, through our three specialized companies - TB Academy, TB Solutions, and TB Digital - 
                we continue to light the torch of innovation, education, and transformation for 
                individuals and organizations worldwide.
